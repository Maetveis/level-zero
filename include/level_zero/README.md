The files in this folder are identical to the ones in `include/`, they are provided to allow
consuming the source folder in the same way as the install folder. For example to allow the compilation of

```cpp
#include <level_zero/ze_api.h>
// Use Level Zero functions
```

with the include path set to `<path-to-level-zero-repository/include>`.
This matches the layout of the header files when they are installed.

Do not edit these files!
